This is my first web-based project,a simple messaging application designed for real-time communication.
Upon accessing the app, users are prompted to enter their username.
Valid users are then directed to a chat room where they can engage in live conversations with two or more participants.
The app displays messages in real-time, facilitating seamless interaction among users.
